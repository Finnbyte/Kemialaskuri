# How to compile and use
After running `git clone <URL of repo>` and having this repo cloned on your computer, you have to compile this into a native executable.
This is done by this simple `go` command: `go build .`. However, this assumes *two things*:
    * You have golang installed on your computer, with a package manager such as **scoop** or from the website.
    * You are currently in the directory, with the source codes. This is done by using `cd` command with your terminal.
